### More documentation coming soon!

### Make sure to check out Docker documentation in `DOCS` directory (as well as SMTP class info)!

## Features
- Compiled Docker image for easy deployment
- Tested with Python 3.10

## Directory/File Structure
- `BUILD/` - Contains any additional assets for building and deploying the application
- `CONFIG/` - Contains configuration files and scripts (i.e. DB setup)
- `PYTHON` - Contains Python scripts and classes for the application
- `DOCS/` - Contains documentation, meeting notes, presentations, and other related files

- `.gitignore` - Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore
- `.vscode/` - Contains VS Code settings and tasks
- `LICENSE` - The main license file for the application
- `README.md` - This file, a manual for your application

- `Dockerfile` - Dockerfile for creating a Docker image of the application
- `docker-compose.yaml` - Docker Compose file for defining and running multi-container Docker applications
- `.env` - Environment file for Docker Compose, contains environment variables
- `.dockerignore` - Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore for Docker compilation

- `main.py` - Main Python script for running the application

## Installation
### Prerequisites/Requirements
- System compatible with Docker. We recommend using the latest version of Ubuntu or Ubuntu Server.
- Preferably 4GB of RAM or more, for running our Docker application.
- Docker and Docker-Compose itself should be installed on your system. For Ubuntu users, you can install Docker with the following commands from Docker's guide:
```bash
# Add Docker's official GPG key:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

# Add the repository to Apt sources:
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update

# Install Docker Engine:
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

### Setup
- Clone the repository to your local machine
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PhysCorp/scribe.git
```
- Change directory to the project root
```bash
cd scribe
```
- Run the following commands to build and run the Docker image
```bash
sudo docker-compose build --no-cache
sudo docker-compose up
```
- It will take a few minutes to build the image and run the container. Once it's done, you can access the application at `http://localhost:98` in your web browser. The default port is 98, but you can change it in the `docker-compose.yaml` file.

- If you will be running from source, make sure you have the following packages installed (adjust package manager according to your distro):
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip
```
- Remember: There are a lot of `.env.example` files in our project! Make sure to rename them to `.env` and fill in the necessary environment variables.

## Development

### Setup MariaDB
Download MariaDB [here](https://mariadb.org/download/)

#### Linux (Tested on Debian)

Run ``sudo su`` to run as root.

Assuming the tarball is still in the Downloads directory
Run the following commands, changing \<USER\> to the user you used to download the tarball:
```sh
groupadd mysql
useradd -g mysql mysql
cd /usr/local
tar -zxvpf /home/<USER>/mariadb-11.4.0-preview-linux-systemd-x86_64.tar.gz
ln -s mariadb-11.4.0-preview-linux-systemd-x86_64/ mysql
cd mysql
./scripts/mariadb-install-db --user=mysql
chown -R root .
chown -R mysql data
```
Run 
```sh
sudo /usr/local/mysql/bin/mariadbd-safe
```
to start the daemon

Add this to the end of your (non-root) .bashrc file to invoke mariadb commands:

```sh
export PATH="/usr/local/mysql/bin:$PATH"
```

### Run Components Locally

#### Run Flask Backend (Port 5000)
```bash
python3 -m flask --app PYTHON.api.app run
# OR
Flask --app PYTHON.api.app run
```

#### Run NiceGUI Frontend (Port 8080)
```bash
python3 ./PYTHON/frontend/frontend_main.py
```

#### VS Code Debugging

Alternatively, if you are using VS Code, you can use the debugging configurations defined in `.vscode/launch.json` to launch either the frontend, backend, or both simultaneously.
To do this, click the "Run and Debug" button in the activity bar on the left, pick your desired configuration from the dropdown, and click the "â–¶" icon.
You can also press the `F5` key to launch the last used configruation.  

## About the Developers
Info will be added soon!

## Additional Note(s)
- Version schema: `YEAR.MONTH.DAY.REVISION`
- Healthcheck should be implemented on Flask side
- Search IDE for "TODO:" as there's placeholders there!
